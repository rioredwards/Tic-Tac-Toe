    int endState = 0;            // 1 = Win, 2 = Lose, 3 = Tie
    int gameState = 0;           // 
    int turnNum = 0;             // incriments every turn. should end at 9
    Tile gameBoard[9] = {a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2, a3, b3, c3}
    char moveInput[2]            // Ex: a1
    char xInput;                 // a,b,c
    char yInput;                 // 1,2,3

    Print:

        Instructions: When prompted, input your move and press enter. 
                      Ex: type "a1" then press "Enter"

Notes:
From Tic-tac-toe wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

A player can play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe (to win or at least draw) if, 
each time it is their turn to play, they choose the first available move from the 
following list, as used in Newell and Simon's 1972 tic-tac-toe program.[16]

1. Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.
2. Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to 
block the opponent.
3. Fork: Cause a scenario where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
4. Blocking an opponent's fork: If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the 
player should block it. Otherwise, the player should block all forks in any way that 
simultaneously allows them to make two in a row. Otherwise, the player should make a 
two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it does not result in them 
producing a fork. For example, if "X" has two opposite corners and "O" has the center, "O" 
must not play a corner move to win. (Playing a corner move in this scenario produces a fork 
for "X" to win.)
5. Center: A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a 
corner move gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore 
be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)
6. Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.
7. Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.
8. Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the four sides.
